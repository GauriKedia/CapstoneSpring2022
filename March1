Right now I’m working on assembling my multiple ideas into one project so I can have a coherent presentation next week.
I am having some issues with the Oculus build settings in Unity so that’s first on the list to sort out. 
I’m planning to have one of the interactions ready at the very least- changing scale. 
One thing that recently occurred to me is that given the time constraints of this project, there’s no way I can have a great variety of interactions. I can focus on a few, and maybe they can be used in combination with one another. But the interactions are not necessarily the more important part of the project. I need to make people want to explore the environment. So to that end, I need to make the environment itself as interesting as possible, with pleasing visual and sonic aesthetics. I’m working on having a lot of sound and movement- like ripples in water, wavy grass, things like that.
I’m starting to work on texturing the elements of the environment as well. This is taking some time because I’m new to the software so hopefully there’ll be a steep learning curve. All the while, I’m trying to keep the colour scheme in mind- I can’t have too much visual noise so determining this will be very important. I think the aesthetic is sort of coming together which is nice, it’s been hard to put what’s in my head on the screen so far but I think it is looking like something I might enjoy playing myself.
This weekend will be crucial to my progress.
Preliminary user testing shows that people seem to like the overall aesthetic of the project and the time cycle looks interesting- but I need to figure out the length of each cycle- too short and it could be disorienting, too long it people may not notice or miss it during one session of play.
