It occurred to me that different people would interact with the Oculus differently than I would. So I’m conducting what may be considered user tests with it, so I can compare others’ interactions with the games I have on the Oculus so I can compare them with mine and see possible various reactions to the same game mechanics. This is largely informal, but I mainly want to make sure I’m not just making my project for myself and that it is accessible to others. This will help me map out decision trees and create the environment of the game. I’m specifically looking for reactions to interactions, visuals, difficulty, game ‘logic’, time spent on the game as a whole/ specific interactions, movement in VR and actual space, and sound effects.
Seeing as I’ve been playing on the Oculus myself, I haven’t done much more in the view of actual development but I’m hoping this exercise will translate into richer and more nuanced game mechanics in my project. 
I’m excited to try out Moss specifically (as soon as I can buy it) so that I can explore the effects of relative scale and environment to interactions and perspectives in the VR space. 
Updates on visual aesthetics: I’m checking out ways to create hand-painted, almost cartoonish textures for a sort of anime-like feel. 
Updates on music: doing research on simple mixing software to create ambient soundtracks. 
Short term goals: finalise interactions/mechanics on consolidated research/user testing stuff and research on how to implement them. Make more objects for the environment, make a skeleton environment.
