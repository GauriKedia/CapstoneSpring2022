More Unity tutorials.
I found one to simulate grass in the wind and an AI for fish flocking (which can be used for birds and insects as well).
Coding is not my best area so the second one took a while to do- but it works. I'm still using place holder assets till I can make my own, which will hopefully be soon. 
I realise I need to set aside dedicated time to play on the Oculus to get the feel of it and the games I buy; right now I don't necessarily take my explorations of the medium seriously enough to be able to implement mechanics for my project.
This entire process is still very overwhelming and hard to keep track of so I'm doing small things I know for sure I'll use- like flocking fish or grass in the wind. 
I think with my previous experiments with shaders I finally narrowed down (sort of) a visual aesthetic for the environment, and I've just gotten the software I need to start creating the right textures. However, I am having trouble with the actual creation process- what I've done so far is tutorial/code/shader based and I'm not sure how to begin actually creating my own elements. Maybe it's an inspiration problem. 
I've been thinking about interactions in a practical sense, and I think if I have a few main ones (eg. picking something up, portalling) and some variations to each, I should have enough complexity and a kind of exploration process to the experience. For example, picking up or touching different things could have different effects on your perception. One kind of stone may change how you perceive colour, a flower could make you hear things differently. 
I'm also putting together and annotated bibliography for convenience when I write my final paper. I think this is helping more than just logistically- rereading or even skimming through the texts helps keep coherent thematically.
